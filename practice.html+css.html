  <center><h2>Amid Struggles, Turkey Finds Heroes in Its Women’s Volleyball Team</h2></center>
  <hr>
  <p>
    <mark><em style="font-size: 30px;">Turkey</em></mark> is basking in the success of players it calls <mark>“Sultans of the Net”</mark> 
    seeing paragons of female empowerment in a country grappling with multiple crises. As the volleyball game neared its end, 
    thousands of fans watching on giant screens in an <mark>Istanbul</mark> park rose to their feet and fell silent. 
    The ball soared, a Turkish player set it up near the net, and her teammate spiked it. Her <del>Italian opponents</del> blocked the shot 
    but knocked the ball out of bounds, handing victory to the Turks and causing the crowd to erupt into chants of <mark><em>“Turkey! Turkey! Turkey!”</em></mark> 

    <br><br>
    <img src="./img/806x378-1693473519237.jpg" alt="tvf" style="float: left; width: 300px;"><u>The nail-biter victory</u> on Friday by <mark><i>Turkey’s national women’s volleyball team</i></mark> in the Women’s European Volleyball Championship was 
    the most recent conquest by the country’s most successful major sports team, a <mark>record</mark> <u style="font-style: italic;">hat has turned it into a rare source of national pride 
      that holds appeal across the country’s social divides.</u>
    

    <br><br>While some ultraconservatives have attacked the women as an affront to Islamic values, their fans laud them as paragons of 
    female empowerment in a country where many women feel they have yet to achieve social equality. And the team’s successes are 
    a welcome bright spot for Turks struggling with sky-high inflation, political polarization and a slow recovery from devastating earthquakes 
    in February that killed more than 50,000 people.

    <img src="./img/Turkish-national-womens-volleyball-team-joy-at-World-Championship_Facebook.jpg" alt="tvf" style="float: right; width: 300px;">
    Affectionately referred to as <mark>“Sultans of the Net”</mark> the team won <u style="color: red;background-color: white;"><i>Volleyball Nations League championship</i></u> the  in July in Arlington, 
    Texas, and <mark>became the world’s top rated women’s national team</mark>, according to FIVB, the sport’s international governing body. On Sunday, 
    the Turkish team faced Serbia in the final match of the European championship in Brussels — and won, 3-2.

    <br><br>At home, the team’s games are aired live by the state broadcaster and its players exude star power. Legions of followers on 
    social media celebrate their accomplishments, track their frequent hair-color changes and speculate about their romantic entanglements.
    
    <br><br>
    <a href="https://www.instagram.com/abreusmelisavargas/?hl=en" target="_blank"><img src="./img/melissa-vargas-nereli.jpg.webp" alt="vargas" style="width: 250px; height: 350px; float: left;"></a>
    Corporate sponsorships and state support have flowed in. In 2021, when Turkey granted citizenship to the Cuban-born player 
    Melissa Vargas, she received her new Turkish ID card from none other than the President of Turkey.
    
    <br><br>“<mark>They are fighters</mark>,” said Ceren Duyan, a biologist at a biotech company who watched Friday’s game in the park. 
    <u style="background-color: white; color: rgb(10, 0, 0);"><i>“When we see women do good things in sports or anywhere else, we see that we too can be powerful.”</i></u> The volleyballers’ rise comes amid an international 
    reckoning with how female athletes are treated compared with their male counterparts. Last month, the head of the Spanish soccer federation
    was suspended after giving a female player an unwanted kiss on the lips. In July, the BBC apologized after one of its reporters asked 
    the captain of the Moroccan national women’s soccer team if any of its players were gay. Turkey’s team has largely avoided 
    such controversies, although the players’ personal styles have linked them to some of Turkey’s deepest divisions. 
    While its people are predominantly Muslim, Turkey was founded in 1923 by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, its first president, 
    as a secular state. Much of Turkish politics revolves around struggles between those who treasure the country’s secular legacy 
    and those pressing to expand Islam’s role in public life. The latter camp includes Mr. Erdogan, Turkey’s predominant politician 
    for two decades.

    The players are clearly in the former camp.
    
    <br><br>They do not cover their hair or wear clothing that conceals their bodies, as most devout Muslim women do. 
    Instead, they appear in the standard uniform of shorts and tank tops, and some sport tattoos. <mark>Ms. Vargas, the team’s top scorer</mark>, 
    has recently appeared on court with her hair dyed electric blue or bleached blond, with a blue lightning bolt over her ear. 
    After a victory on Wednesday against Poland, one player, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fencrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com%2Flicensed-image%3Fq%3Dtbn%3AANd9GcRSLn1QydJp6nrjs9BUm-UEj2V4IXgEPCw2YaJl24lvYf57DE0DJ-SdEMIqNBSblJly4sbHmIlyTFTnixg&psig=AOvVaw3KLSSofZgAMn041NLJl7Wc&ust=1694167714227000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBAQjRxqFwoTCLjdstigmIEDFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE" target="_blank" style="width: auto; height: auto;"><mark style="color: rgb(122, 85, 156);">Zehra Gunes</mark></a> , told Turkish reporters that the team was advancing 
    Ataturk’s vision for Turkey. <u style="font-style: italic; font-size: 24px; color: coral;">“As Turkish women, we try to be role models for future generations by holding a light on the path that Ataturk showed,”</u> 
    she said.
    
    <br><br><mark>Another star player, <a href="https://cdn.odatv5.com/images/2023_09/2023_09_02/odatv_image_98__582ea856012a44.png" target="_blank" style="width: auto; height: auto; color: rgb(243, 82, 195);">Ebrar Karakurt</a></mark>, received floods of hateful and homophobic messages after posting photographs of herself 
    on social media in affectionate poses with other women, and an Islamist newspaper called her “a national shame.”
    <br>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFw8WLOxCtE" target="_blank"><img src="./img/ebrar.webp" alt="ebrar" style="width: 400px; height: 400px; float: right;"></a>
    
    <br><br>In 2021, when the team was competing in the Summer Olympics in Tokyo, a prominent preacher sharply criticized the team for 
    not adhering to his conception of how a Muslim woman should behave.
    <br>

    
    <br><br>“Girl of Islam! You are not the sultan of the courts; you are the sultan of faith, virtue, chastity and decency,” the preacher, 
    Ihsan Senocak, wrote on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter.
    
    <br><br>A spokesman for Turkey’s volleyball federation eventually responded to the hubbub, praising Ms. Karakurt for having the 
    “the spirit of a fighter to represent her country.”
    “Everyone’s private life concerns them only,” the spokesman said. “All the rest is hokum.”
    Ms. Karakurt has recently struck back at her critics in her own way.
    
    <br><br>Last week, an X user named Abdulhamid responded to one of her posts, saying, “As the Muslim Turkish nation,
    we continue to put up with you.”
    After Friday’s victory, Ms. Karakurt posted a photograph of herself holding a sign that read, <u style="font-style: italic; font-size: 24px; color: coral;">“Cut the crap, Abdulhamid.”</u>
    The team’s successes resonate because Turkey has long seen sports as a way to assert itself globally. 
    “It was always the motive of Turkish sports to be successful in international encounters to prove that we are legitimate — as powerful, 
    as successful, equals to our Western peers,” said Daghan Irak, a senior lecturer in media communication at the University of Huddersfield 
    in Britain. <mark>“It is a very important part of our society’s psyche in terms of sports.”  </mark>
