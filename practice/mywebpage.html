        Turkey's position at the crossroads of the land, sea and air routes between the three <mark> Old World</mark> continents and 
        the variety of the habitats across its geographical regions have produced considerable species diversity and a vibrant <mark>ecosystem</mark>.
        <br>
        <br><u><i><mark>Anatolia is the homeland of many plants that have been cultivated for food since the advent of agriculture, 
            and the wild ancestors of many flowers and plants that now provide staples for humankind still grow in Turkey</mark></i></u> . 
        <br>
        <br>The diversity of Turkey's fauna is even greater than that of <mark>its flora</mark>. 
            The number of animal species in the whole of <mark>Europe</mark> is around 60,000, 
            while in Turkey there are over 80,000 animal species (over 100,000 counting the subspecies).

        The <u><i><mark>Northern Anatolian conifer and deciduous forests</mark></i></u> is an ecoregion which covers most of the Pontic Mountains in northern Turkey, 
        while the <u><i><mark>Caucasus mixed forests</mark></i></u> extend across the eastern end of the range. The region is home to Eurasian wildlife such as the Eurasian sparrowhawk, 
        golden eagle, eastern imperial eagle, lesser spotted eagle, Caucasian black grouse, red-fronted serin, and wallcreeper. 
        <br>
        <br>The narrow coastal strip between the Pontic Mountains and the Black Sea is home to the Euxine-Colchic deciduous forests, 
        which contain some of the world's few temperate rainforests. The Turkish pine (Pinus brutia) is mostly found in Turkey and 
        other east Mediterranean countries. 
        <br>
        <br>The forests of Turkey have other species of Pinus (pine), the Turkey oak and 
        numerous other species of oak. The most commonly found species of the genus Platanus (plane) is the orientalis. 
        Several wild species of tulip are native to Anatolia, and the flower was first introduced to Western Europe with species taken from 
        the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century.

        There are <u><i><mark>40 national parks</mark></i></u>, 189 nature parks, 31 nature preserve areas, 80 wildlife protection areas and 109 nature monuments 
        in Turkey such as <mark>Peninsula Historical National Park, Mount Nemrut National Park, Ancient Troy National Park, 
        Ölüdeniz Nature Park and Polonezköy Nature Park</mark> . In the 21st century, threats to biodiversity include desertification 
        due to climate change in Turkey.
        <br>
        <br>The Anatolian leopard is still found in very small numbers in the northeastern and southeastern regions of Turkey. 
        The Eurasian lynx, the European wildcat and the Caracal are other felid species which are currently found in the forests of Turkey. 
        <br>
        <br>The Caspian tiger, now extinct, lived in the easternmost regions of Turkey until the latter half of the 20th century.
        Renowned domestic animals from Ankara, the capital of Turkey, include the Angora cat, Angora rabbit and Angora goat; and from Van Province
        the Van cat. The national dog breeds are the Kangal (Anatolian Shepherd), Malaklı and Akbaş.

        The coastal areas of Turkey bordering the Aegean and Mediterranean Seas have a temperate Mediterranean climate, with hot, 
        dry summers and mild to cool, wet winters. The coastal areas bordering the Black Sea have a temperate oceanic climate with warm, 
        wet summers and cool to cold, wet winters. 
        <br>
        <br>The Turkish Black Sea coast receives the most precipitation and is 
        the only region of Turkey that receives high precipitation throughout the year. The eastern part of the Black Sea coast 
        averages 2,200 millimetres (87 in) annually which is the highest precipitation in the country. The coastal areas bordering 
        the Sea of Marmara, which connects the Aegean Sea and the Black Sea, have a transitional climate between a temperate 
        Mediterranean climate and a temperate oceanic climate with warm to hot, moderately dry summers and cool to cold, wet winters.
        <br>
        <br><u><i>Snow falls on the coastal areas of the Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea almost every winter, but usually melts in no more 
            than a few days. However, snow is rare in the coastal areas of the Aegean Sea and very rare in the coastal areas of 
            the Mediterranean Sea. <mark>Winters on the Anatolian plateau are especially severe</mark>. Temperatures of −30 to −40 °C (−22 to −40 °F) 
            do occur in northeastern Anatolia, and snow may lie on the ground for at least 120 days of the year, and during the entire year 
            on the summits of the highest mountains. In central Anatolia the temperatures can drop below −20 °C (−4 °F) 
            with the mountains being even colder</i></u>.
